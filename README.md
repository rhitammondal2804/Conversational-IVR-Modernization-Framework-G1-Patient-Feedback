# Conversational IVR Modernization Framework  
**Use Case:** Patient Feedback IVR for Hospitals  
**Intern:** Rhitam Mondal | **Group:** 1  

## Overview
This project modernizes legacy VoiceXML (VXML) IVR systems by integrating them with Conversational AI technologies. Traditional hospital IVRs rely on rigid, menu-driven interactions that require patients to press multiple keys, often causing confusion, delays, and call drop-offs—especially for elderly or non-technical users.

## Objective
The goal is to enable natural, voice-based patient feedback by integrating legacy IVR systems with:
- **Azure Communication Services (ACS)** for call handling, speech-to-text, and text-to-speech.
- **Bot Application Platform (BAP)** for intent detection and conversational dialogue management.
- A **middleware layer** to connect AI components with existing VXML logic and hospital backend systems.

## Key Benefits
- Natural language interaction
- Improved accessibility and user experience
- Detailed patient feedback collection
- Reduced redevelopment effort
- Scalable and future-ready architecture

This framework enhances patient satisfaction while helping hospitals gain actionable insights through a modern conversational IVR system.
