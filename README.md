# Patient-Feedback-IVR-G1 – Conversational IVR Modernization Framework

A streamlined approach to modernizing legacy hospital IVR systems using Conversational AI. Built with a focus on accessibility, performance, and clear documentation.

🏥 PatientVoice AI: Smarter Patient Feedback Collection  
This project is based on a simple observation: hospitals need honest, detailed patient feedback, but traditional “Press 1, Press 2” IVR systems are confusing, time-consuming, and often ignored—especially by elderly patients.

This solution bridges legacy hospital IVR systems with modern conversational AI, making feedback as simple as talking to a human assistant.

## 🌟 What’s the Big Idea?
Imagine a patient receiving a feedback call and simply speaking naturally instead of navigating menus.

- **Talk naturally:** “I want to give feedback about my appointment.”
- **Smart understanding:** AI detects the patient’s intent and guides the conversation.
- **Detailed responses:** Patients can describe their experience in their own words.
- **Instant storage:** Feedback is stored directly in the hospital system for analysis.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
This project focuses on integrating legacy systems with modern conversational technologies:

- **The Voice Layer:**  
  Azure Communication Services (ACS) – call handling, speech-to-text, text-to-speech 📞

- **The AI Brain:**  
  Bot Application Platform (BAP) – intent detection and conversation management 🧠

- **The Bridge:**  
  Middleware/API layer – connects conversational AI to legacy VXML IVR logic

- **The Memory:**  
  Hospital backend systems and databases
